# Paradigm Agnostic Code Embeddings

This is a final project for Computational Linguistics II. The project comes in two parts.

1. Replicating the results of [Language Agnostic Code Embeddings by Utpala et al (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16803).
2. Extension to analyze the paradigm (e.g. functional, procedural, OO) components of code embeddings.
